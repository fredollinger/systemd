systemd can't handle the process previlege that belongs to user name startswith
number, such as 0day

In case of bug report: Expected behaviour you didn't see

    The process started by systemd should be user previlege

In case of bug report: Steps to reproduce the problem

linux user's name : 0day
conf file: socat.service

[Unit]
Description=0day socat service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=0day
Restart=always
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/home/0day/
ExecStart=/usr/bin/socat TCP-LISTEN:18086,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:"/opt/run-elf"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

and then use systemctl start socat.service to start process, but the previlege is root

P.S.
I searched google and found that it was not right to named a linux user with 0day, it should satisfy "^[a-z][-a-z0-9]*\$ , but when I use xinted to start the service, it can handle the previlege rightly with linux user 0day
